	<h2><p> I'm not a very tall person, persons often look down on people below average but I try to drown that out with my outspokeness and confidence.
			That was never always the case as I wasn't very confident in my earlier years, one of the things I took an interest in was football, I usually just played
			because everyone else would play and it wasn't until highschool I developed a genuine passion for it. Nowadays I play as often as possible with others in the community.
			I even tried track and field and that's when I started exercising, though i'm still indisciplined I try doing a few sets everyday. I love music, and am constantly finding new music to listen to.
			Another aspect of entertainment I love is reality TV. Learning about real people, especially comedians and watching comedy skits and standup is something I really enjoy.
			I have a few common pet peeves here and there but there isn't something I truly hate or dislike. I'm not a big fan of large social events such as parties, however I do have the occasional drink and I do like being around 3 or 4 friends.
			I do believe in possibilities and something I feel passionate about is the fact that no one knows anything beyond science. Living in a trying christian home is difficult with a mindset 
			such as mine but I also know i'm not and never will be the only one that thinks like this so that makes me feel better.
