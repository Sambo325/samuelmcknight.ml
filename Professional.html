	<h2><p align="center-right"> My early childhood education began at Unity Primary and Infant School,
		where I passed the then GSAT exams and was then placed at Kingston College to under go my secondary education.
		Throughout my time there I tried to commit myself to a number of clubs and extra curricular activities.
		By the end of 11th grade I was duly acknowledged for taking part in Key Club, Writer's Club and Octagon Club. </h2>

	<h2>I graduated on June 24, 2018. Awaited exam results and was pleased to discover I had passed all subjects I had attempted.</h2>

		<h2 align="center-right"> I hit a stumbling block afterward, where,
		even though I was accepted to participate in the sixth form programme at Kingston College I wanted to try something new.
		So I applied and got accepted into Oberlin High School's sixth form. It was a school near me and it provided a catalogue of benefits I simply could not overlook.
		I lived in close proximity to the school and the school fee presented much cheaper than that of my previous school.
		The proximity of the school to my home allowed me to partake in sporting activities such as football and track and field, in their respective seasons.
		I made quite a number of friends and I truly regret only deciding to spend one year in the sixth form programme.
		I took the CAPE examinations, passing the 4 subjects I took and there ended my time at Oberlin.

	<h2> I started attending The University of Technology on August 26, 2019. After many years of not being sure of what career path to choose, I decided to choose computing.
		 After four or more years of study I hope to obtain my degree to take the next step in achieving my ambitions and building a simple and stable life.
