	<h2><p> One of my strengths is that I learn fast especially if it's something i'm genuinly interested in. I'm able to listen and grasp every detail and replicate if necessary. However if it's not something I find interesting, my efforts wouldn't be lacklustre but rather just not 100%
		Another one of my strengths I believe is I keep going until I get something. A perfect example is with programming, throughout the languages a lot of concepts are the same but regardless I don't always move as quickly and i'm not always as efficient as I could be if I didn't practice until i got better.
		Last but by no means least, learning from mistakes is important to develope. And that's something I do well. Something i've had to do time and time again to move forward in both my professional and personal lives.
		Over the past 5 or so years i;ve learnt a significant amount from individuals i've been around. Discovering things I had a passion for and things I take interest in has helped me want to learn faster and more abou them as much as is possible.
		Throughout my educational life i've taken a lot of subjects which required practice and if I was practicing back then I would have better results from a number of examinations today, practicing today is crucial in the way I learn.
		I like everyone else have done stupid things that were a waste of time and benefited me either short term or in no way at all. I most definately believe I will make more mistakes but my past ones won't ever be repeated.Overall I would say i've developed each of these attributes over time and I am a better person today.

	<h2> I do think these tests have a significant amount of validity because human behaviour is an incredible study. In terms of my personal results shown above, I agree with what I fully understand and I don't think the terms i'm unfamiliar with are any less accurate.</h2>
